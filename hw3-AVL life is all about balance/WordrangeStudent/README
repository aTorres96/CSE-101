CSE 101 Homework 3

Alexander Torres, November 2022

	All of the functions except for the int, and void range functions,
were originally written by C. Seshadhri, from the BST codes file, and I changed them to use strings.
The wordrange file was written using C. Seshadhri's treewrapper.cpp file a template.
	This file uses a binary search tree and finds the range of words between
word1 and word2, by looking through the entire tree.
