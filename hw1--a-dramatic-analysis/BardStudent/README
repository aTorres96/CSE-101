For the Bubble sort (bubsort) and swap functions I implemented the algorithm
found on: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort-for-linked-list-by-swapping-nodes/

The templates I used for my header file, billfunctions.cpp, and main bard.cpp files
were referenced from the LinkedList project created by Japheth Frolick and C. Seshadari.
The functions I used from their project are, reverseList, length, and the linked list constructor.
Other functions they wrote that are present in this file, although not used, are deleteList,
and print(). I also used their code to stream, open and close files. I used their insert function
and added code to check if the word was alreadt present and to increment the frequency of the word
if it is already present. The struct node in the billheader.h header file was also created by Frolick
and Seshadari, and I added the integer for frequency.
